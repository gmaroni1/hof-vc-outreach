```
Hi [CEO Name],

Congrats on the impressive progress with [Company Name]! What you're building is extremely compelling ‚Äì the way [Company Name] is leveraging [Company Description]

For quick context, I'm on the investment team at HOF Capital, a $3B+ AUM multi-stage VC firm that has backed transformative ventures including OpenAI, xAI, Epic Games, UiPath, and Rimac Automobili. Each year, we selectively partner with visionary founders who leverage cutting-edge technology to tackle significant societal and operational challenges, much like [Company Name] is doing in redefining the creative landscape. Additionally, our LP base includes influential leaders across consumer and technology industries, providing extensive strategic value.

I'd love to set up some time to connect and explore how HOF could potentially contribute and accelerate [Company Name]'s journey to becoming a generational company. Here's my calendar.

Looking forward to speaking soon!

Cheers,
Giacomo M.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Python Flask web server
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4 + Requests
- **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions for CEO/founder detection

### Data Sources

The system attempts to gather information from:
1. Company's official website (meta descriptions, about pages)
2. Google search results (company descriptions, leadership info)
3. Multiple fallback strategies for robust data extraction

### Privacy & Ethics

- Respects robots.txt and rate limiting
- Uses public information only
- Implements delays between requests to be respectful to servers
- Does not store or cache company data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Company information not found"**:
   - Try using the full, official company name
   - Some newer companies may have limited online presence

2. **Slow performance**:
   - Initial requests may take longer due to cold start
   - Complex company names may require more research time

3. **Network errors**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Some corporate firewalls may block web scraping

### Improving Results

- Use official company names (e.g., "OpenAI" instead of "Open AI")
- Include suffixes if needed (e.g., "Stripe Inc" if "Stripe" doesn't work)
- For very new companies, you may need to manually edit the generated email

## Security Notes

- The application runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external services except for web scraping
- No API keys or credentials required
- All processing happens on your local system
